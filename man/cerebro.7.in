.SH "NAME"
cerebro \- cluster monitoring tools and libraries
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Cerebro
is a collection of monitoring tools and libraries.  It is made up of a
daemon, loadable modules, a library, and several tools.

The daemon,
.B cerebrod(8),
is the core of
.B Cerebro.
The daemon should be run on every node of a cluster.  It is
responsible for sending, receiving, and monitoring various metric
data.

.B Cerebrod(8)
may be configured to gather/send data (be a \fIspeaker\fR),
collect/receive data (be a \fIlistener\fR), or both.  Typically, it is
configured to be a \fIspeaker\fR on all the nodes of a cluster, and is
a \fIlistener\fR on only a few nodes of a cluster.  However, Cerebro
may be setup a multitude of ways depending on the situation.

By default,
.B cerebrod(8)
sends and receives data via a multicast address on a set of defined
ports.  However, it can be reconfigured to use non-multicast addresses
and other alternate default ports.

The metric data that
.B cerebrod(8)
gathers and sends is dependent on the what data is configured for
monitoring.
Data can be fed into the daemon using
.B cerebro
metric modules,
.B libcerebro(3),
or
.B cerebro-admin(8).
Data gathered or fed into
.B cerebrod(8)
\fIspeakers\fR are ultimately sent to \fIlisteners\fR.

.B Cerebro
monitoring modules,
.B libcerebro(3)
and
.B cerebro-stat(8)
offer the user the ability to collect/receive monitored data on
\fIlisteners\fR.

Before
.B cerebro
can be used as a whole it must be configured.
See
.B cerebro.conf(5)
for a complete list and description of configuration file options.  A
general overview of configuration and setup can be found below.

.SH "CEREBRO MODULES"

Dynamically loadable modules can be developed for
.B cerebrod
for a variety of purposes, including configuration, data
gathering/sending, data collection/receiving, or data logging.

Most
users will likely want to use the
.B libcerebro(3)
library or script against the
.B cerebro-stat(8)
or
.B cerebro-admin(8)
tools.

However for those users interested, a summary of the types of modules
available for
.B Cerebro
can be found in the
.B cerebro_module(3)
manpage.  Detailed programming information for the modules can be
found in the
.B cerebro_modules(3)
manpage.

.SH "CEREBRO EVENTS"

.B Cerebro
also has the ability to generate events when certain types of data
event occur.  For example, an event could be generated when a node
goes down in the cluster.  An event notification API is provided with
.B libcerebro(3)
for programming against these events or they can be watched via
.B cerebro-stat(8).

For more information, see
.B libcerebro(3)
and
.B cerebro_module(3).

.SH "COMMON CONFIGURATION AND SETUP"

The default
.B cerebro
configuration file is @CEREBRO_CONFIG_FILE_DEFAULT@.  Detailed
configuration information can be found in
.B cerebro.conf(5).
However, the following should be a suitable for most users.

For most users, users will wish to gather/send (\fIspeak\fR) data on
all cluster nodes, but only receive data (\fIlisten\fR) on a few
nodes.  Therefore all cluster nodes should be configured with
.I cerebrod_speak
enabled on all nodes so they can send out metric data.
The management, collection, or head nodes should be configured with
.I cerebrod_listen
enabled so they can receive/gather metric information.  It should be
disabled on all remaining nodes.

The
.I cerebrod_metric_controller
should be enabled if metric data will be fed into
.B cerebrod
via
.B libcerebro
and/or
.B cerebro-admin.
Typically, this means it should be enabled wherever
.I cerebrod_speak
is enabled.

The
.I cerebrod_metric_server
should be enabled if metric data will be read from
.B cerebrod
via
.B libcerebro
and/or
.B cerebro-stat.
Typically, this means it should be enabled wherever
.I cerebrod_listen
is enabled.

By default,
.B cerebrod
will communicate using multicast.  It will pick the first network
interface it can find that is capable of using multicast.  To pick an alternate
network interface, please use the
.I cerebrod_speak_message_config
and
.I cerebrod_listen_message_config
configuration options to configure alternate network interfaces to
use.  If so desired, a non-multicast addresses can also be configured
with these options.

If event monitoring is desired, the
.I cerebrod_event_server
should be enabled.  Typically, it is enabled wherever
.I cerebrod_listen
is enabled.

Tools such as
.B cerebro-admin
and
.B cerebro-stat
must commonly access a listening
.B cerebrod
daemon.  They default to communicating to the \fIlocalhost\fR, but
that can be modified by configuring alternate defaults into
.I cerebro_metric_server
and
.I cerebro_event_server.

If the default ports chosen by any services of
.B cerebro
conflict with existing services, they can be reconfigured
and alternate default ports via a variety of options.  Please see
.B cerebro.conf(5)
for more details.

After configuring
.B cerebro
on all cluster hosts, please start the daemon on all nodes.

If things are setup correctly, you should be able to run

.B # /usr/sbin/cerebro-stat -m updown_state

and see a list of nodes currently sending/receiving
.B cerebrod
heartbeats.

To see if metric data can be sent and collected, on a \fIspeaker\fR node, register a metric and feed some data to
.B cerebrod
via:

.B # /usr/sbin/cerebro-admin -r -m foobar

.B # /usr/sbin/cerebro-admin -p -m foobar -t 5 -l 'avalue'

In the above example, I have registered a metric called "foobar" and updated its value to "avalue".

On a \fIlistener\fR node, see that the value of "foobar" has bee propagated to it by running:

.B # /usr/sbin/cerebro-stat -l

and hopefully you should see the value "avalue" when you run

.B # /usr/sbin/cerebro-stat -m foobar

Finally, when you are done, you should unregister the metric on the original \fIspeaker\fR node via:

.B # /usr/sbin/cerebro-admin -u -m foobar
