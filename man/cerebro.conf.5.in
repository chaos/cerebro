.TH cerebro.conf 5 "May 2005" "cerebro.conf @VERSION@" "cerebro.conf"
.SH "NAME"
cerebro.conf \- cerebro configuration file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B cerebro
configuration file configures the features and behavior of the
.B libcerebro
library and the
.B cerebrod
daemon.  The configuration ultimately affects the utility and behavior
of the
.B Cerebro
suite of tools and libraries.  Please see
.BR cerebro(7)
for an overview of the
.B Cerebro
system and common configuration/setup information.

The default configuration file loaded is @CEREBRO_CONFIG_FILE_DEFAULT@.

The configuration options that can be specified in the configuration
file are listed below into appropriate sections.  Each configuration
option must be listed on a separate line.  Arguments for an option are
separated by any amount of whitespace.  Multiple arguments are also
separated by whitespace.  Comments can be marked by using the pound
sign ("#") character, and lines can be continued on the next using
backslash (".\").

.SH "CEREBRO CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
.TP
.I cerebro_metric_server hostname [port]
Specify an alternate default metric server host and port the
libcerebro API should attempt to connect to.  Metric reading tools
such as
.B cerebro-stat
connect to the metric server to read metric data.  This option can be
listed multiple times to specify multiple hosts.  If the port is not
specified, a default is assumed.

.TP
.I cerebro_event_server hostname [port]
Specify an alternate default event server host and port the libcerebro
API should attempt to connect to.  Event reading tools such as
.B cerebro-stat
connect to the event server to read event data.  This option can be
listed multiple times to specify multiple hosts.  If the port is not
specified, a default is assumed.
.TP
.I cerebro_timeout_len num
Specify the alternate default timeout length the libcerebro API should
use to evaluate up vs. down nodes.  Defaults to 60 seconds.
.TP
.I cerebro_flags num
Specify the alternate default flags the libcerebro API should use by
default.
.SH "CEREBROD CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
.TP
.I cerebrod_heartbeat_frequency ( sec | sec_min sec_max )
Specify the frequency at which the the
.B cerebrod
daemon sends out heartbeat packets containing
.B Cerebro
information.  The frequency should be specified in seconds.  The
frequency can be specified either as a static frequency or a range of
frequencies.  If a range is specified, a random number of seconds
within that range is selected for every heartbeat packet sent.  The
default value is a minimum frequency of 10 seconds and a maximum
frequency of 20 seconds.
.TP
.I cerebrod_speak ( on | off )
Specify if the
.B cerebrod
daemon should send out packets or not.  Generally speaking, this should
always be turned on.  The default configuration turns this option on.
.TP
.I cerebrod_speak_message_config ip [destination_port source_port network_interface]
Specify where cerebro messages should be sent to and where they should
be sent from.  This option can be listed multiple times to specify
multiple message destinations.  The ip address specifies the
destination ip address that messages should be sent to.  It may be
specified as a hostname, singlecast ip address, or multicast ip address.
The default ip address is 239.2.11.72.  The destination port specifies
the port that messages should be sent to.  The default destination
port is 8851.  The source port specifies the port that messages should
be sent from.  The default source port is 8850.  The network interface
specifies the network interface messages should be sent out of.  This
is typically used to specify a network when a multicast ip address is
specified as the message destination.  The network interface can be
specified as a network interface (e.g.  eth0), an ip address
(e.g. 192.168.1.1) or a subnet using CIDR notation
(e.g. 192.168.1.1/16).  By default, when a network interface is not
specified,
.B cerebrod
will search for and select an appropriate network interface. If the
machine running
.B cerebrod
contains multiple network interfaces, it would be recommended that the
appropriate network interface be configured.  The destination_port,
source_port, and network_interface may be optionally specified.
To use defaults for the ip address or network interface, '0.0.0.0' may
be specified.  To use defaults for destination_port or source_port a
 '0' may be specified.
.TP
.I cerebrod_speak_message_ttl num
Specify the spoken message packet time to live parameter.  This
parameter is only used if the message destination ip address is a
multicast ip address.  The default ttl is 1.
.TP
.I cerebrod_listen ( on | off )
Specify if the
.B cerebrod
daemon should receive packets or not.  Generally speaking, this option
should be turned off for all but just a few machines in a cluster.  Just
a few of the machines should be responsible for collecting the
.B Cerebro
data so that computational power of the cluster as a whole isn't lost.
The default configuration turns this option on.
.TP
.I cerebrod_listen_message_config ip [port network_interface]
Specify from where cerebro messages should be received.  This option
can be listed multiple times to specify multiple message destinations.
The ip address specifies the ip address that messages should be
received on.  It may be specified as a hostname, singlecast ip address, or
multicast ip address.  The default ip address is 239.2.11.72.  The
port specifies the port that messages should be received on.  The
default port is 8851.  The network interface specifies the network
interface messages should be received on.  This is typically used to
specify a network when a multicast ip address is specified as the
message receiving ip.  The network interface can be specified as a
network interface (e.g.  eth0), an ip address (e.g. 192.168.1.1) or a
subnet using CIDR notation (e.g. 192.168.1.1/16).  By default, when a
network interface is not specified,
.B cerebrod
will search for and
select an appropriate network interface. If the machine running
.B cerebrod
contains multiple network interfaces, it would be recommended that the
appropriate network interface be configured.  The port and
network_interface may be optionally specified.  To use defaults for
the ip address or network interface, '0.0.0.0' may be specified.  To
use defaults for the port, a '0' may be specified.
.TP
.I cerebrod_listen_threads num
Specify the number of listening threads the
.B cerebrod
listener server should execute.  The default executes 2 threads.
.TP
.I cerebrod_metric_controller ( on | off )
Specify if the
.B cerebrod
daemon should turn on the metric controller.  Generally speaking, this
option should be turned on if the
.I cerebrod_speak
option is turned on.  If the
.I cerebrod_speak
option is turned off, the metric_controller will not be started.  The default
turns this option on as long as the
.I cerebrod_speak
option is turned on.  This must be turned on for metric administration tools
such as
.B cerebro-admin
to connect to the
.B cerebrod
daemon.
.TP
.I cerebrod_metric_server ( on | off )
Specify if the
.B cerebrod
daemon should turn on the metric server.  Generally speaking, this
option should be turned on if the
.I cerebrod_listen
option is turned on.  If the
.I cerebrod_listen
option is turned off, the metric_server will not be started.  The default
turns this option on as long as the
.I cerebrod_listen
option is turned on.  This must be turned on for metric reading tools
such as
.B cerebro-stat
to connect to the
.B cerebrod
daemon.
.TP
.I cerebrod_metric_server_port num
Specify the metric server port.  The default server port is 8852.
.TP
.I cerebrod_event_server ( on | off )
Specify if the
.B cerebrod
daemon should turn on the event server.  Generally speaking, this
option should be turned on if the
.I cerebrod_listen
option is turned on.  If the
.I cerebrod_listen
option is turned off, the event_server will not be started.  The default
turns this option on as long as the
.I cerebrod_listen
option is turned on.
.TP
.I cerebrod_event_server_port num
Specify the event server port.  The default server port is 8853.
.TP
.I cerebrod_forward_message_config ip [destination_port source_port network_interface host1 host2 ...]
Specify where cerebro messages received should be forwarded to and
where they should be forwarded from.  This option is typically used to
forward packets from one listener to another, typically in an
environment in which a tree or network of shared data may wish to be
formed.  Most users will not be interested in this option, as data
will be sufficiently shared via \fIspeaker\fR and \fIlistener\fR
nodes.

This option can be listed multiple times to specify
multiple forwarding destinations.  The ip address specifies the
destination ip address that messages should be sent to.  It may be
specified as a hostname, singlecast ip address, or multicast ip address.
The default ip address is 239.2.11.72.  The destination port specifies
the port that messages should be sent to.  The default destination
port is 8851.  The source port specifies the port that messages should
be sent from.  The default source port is 8849.  The network interface
specifies the network interface messages should be sent out of.  This
is typically used to specify a network when a multicast ip address is
specified as the message destination.  The network interface can be
specified as a network interface (e.g.  eth0), an ip address
(e.g. 192.168.1.1) or a subnet using CIDR notation
(e.g. 192.168.1.1/16).  By default, when a network interface is not
specified,
.B cerebrod
will search for and select an appropriate network interface. If the
machine running
.B cerebrod
contains multiple network interfaces, it would be recommended that the
appropriate network interface be configured.  Multiple hosts can be
specified to indicate metric data from specific hosts in your cluster
should be forwarded.  The hosts can be specified space separated,
comma separated, or hostranged.  If no hosts are specified, all data
will be forwarded to the destination.  The hosts must be specified in
their shortened hostname form.  The destination_port, source_port,
network_interfacem and hosts may be optionally specified.  To use
defaults for the ip address or network interface, '0.0.0.0' may be
specified.  To use defaults for destination_port or source_port a
 '0' may be specified.
.TP
.I cerebrod_forward_message_ttl num
Specify the forwarded message packet time to live parameter.  This
parameter is only used if the message destination ip address is a
multicast ip address.  The default ttl is 1.
.TP
.I cerebrod_forward_host_accept host1 host2 host3 ...
Specify hosts that are not in the cluster that
.B cerebrod
should accept because packets are being forwarded to it.  This option
is particularly useful for a
.B cerebrod
daemon that is running off cluster as a general "data collector".
Hosts must be specified in their shortened hostname form.  The hosts
can be specified space separated, comma separated, or hostranged.
.TP
.I cerebrod_metric_module_exclude str1 str2 str3 ...
Specify metric module names that
.B cerebrod
should not load.
.TP
.I cerebrod_monitor_module_exclude str1 str2 str3 ...
Specify monitor module names that
.B cerebrod
should not load.
.TP
.I cerebrod_event_module_exclude str1 str2 str3 ...
Specify event module names that
.B cerebrod
should not load.
.TP
.I cerebrod_speak_debug ( on | off )
Turn on/off speak debugging.  Requires that debugging be turned on from
the command line with the
.I -d
option.  This option is turned off by default.
.TP
.I cerebrod_listen_debug ( on | off )
Turn on/off listen debugging.  Requires that debugging be turned on from
the command line with the
.I -d
option.  This option is turned off by default.
.TP
.I cerebrod_metric_controller_debug ( on | off )
Turn on/off metric controller debugging.  Requires that debugging be turned on
from the command line with the
.I -d
option.  This option is turned off by default.
.TP
.I cerebrod_metric_server_debug ( on | off )
Turn on/off metric server debugging.  Requires that debugging be turned on
from the command line with the
.I -d
option.  This option is turned off by default.
.TP
.I cerebrod_event_server_debug ( on | off )
Turn on/off event server debugging.  Requires that debugging be turned on
from the command line with the
.I -d
option.  This option is turned off by default.
.TP
.I cerebrod_gettimeofday_workaround ( on | off )
Turn on/off workarounds to get around systems with bugs with
gettimeofday().  This option is turned off by default.
