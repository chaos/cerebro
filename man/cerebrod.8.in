.SH "NAME"
cerebrod \- cerebro monitoring daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B cerebrod [OPTIONS]
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B cerebrod
daemon is responsible for receiving and distributing cluster node data
from each node in the cluster for use within the
.B Cerebro
suite of tools and libraries.

The 
.B cerebrod
daemon can be configured using the cerebro configuration file or having
a cerebro configuration loaded.  The configuration changes can alter
the features and behavior of the daemon as well as the 
.B Cerebro
suite of tools and libraries.

See the
.BR cerebro.conf(5)
and
.BR cerebro_module(3) 
manpages for additional information on configuration.

Depending on the configuration of your cluster, the
.B cerebrod
daemon may need to be restarted to recognize a new configuration.

For example, if additional nodes have been added into your cluster,
.B cerebrod
may need to be restrated to reload any cluster data files so these
new nodes will be recognized.
