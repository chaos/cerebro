.TH CEREBRO_MODULE 3 "May 2005" "LLNL" "CEREBRO_MODULE"
.SH "NAME" 
cerebro_module \- Introduction to cerebro modules
.SH CLUSTERLIST MODULES

In order for
.B Cerebro
to be utilized at its full potential, a list of cluster nodes should be
loaded.
.B Cerebro
can be used without a clusterlist, but some features will be
diminished without one.  For example, there will be no way to
determine the down nodes of the cluster if there is no knowledge of
what all of the nodes in the cluster actually are.

The list of cluster nodes can be specified in several formats by using
one of a number of clusterlist modules.

The following config modules are distributed:

.if @MANPAGE_GENDERS@ \{
genders - Reads and parses a generic genders database.  Can be passed
a filename=value option to specify an non-default genders database
location.

\}

.if @MANPAGE_HOSTSFILE@ \{
hostsfile - Reads and parses a file listing each cluster node on a
separate line.  Can be passed a filename=value option to specify an
non-default hostsfile database location.  The default hostsfile is
located at @CEREBRO_CLUSTERLIST_HOSTSFILE_DEFAULT@.
\}

Clusterlist modules are searched for in the
.B Cerebro
package library directory, @CEREBRO_MODULE_DIR@, in the above order.
If none of the above are found,
.B cerebrod
will search for other clusterlist modules.

If a clusterlist module cannot be found, a default is assumed in which
all messages received by the
.B cerebrod(8)
daemon make up the cluster.

.SH "CONFIG MODULES"

A configuration module format has been developed into
.B Cerebro
to alleviate the potential difficulty of configuring many different
cluster nodes with different configuration files.  The configuration
module loads an alternate set of default configuration options.  For
example, if the cluster contains a cluster configuration database, a
configuration module could be written to read from the cluster
configuration database, and configure each node accordingly.

The configuration loaded by a configuration module can be overrided by
the options specified in the configuration file.

The following config modules are distributed:

No config modules are built.

Configuration modules are searched for in the
.B Cerebro
package library directory, @CEREBRO_MODULE_DIR@, in the above order.
If none of the above are found,
.B cerebrod
will search for other configuration modules.

If a configuration module cannot be found, the default configuration
is assumed.

.SH "METRIC MODULES"

Metric modules provide a way for the
.B cerebrod
daemon to retrieve system data so that other additional
system data can be propogated.  Multiple metric modules can be
opened by a speaking
.B cerebrod
daemon.

The following metric modules are distributed:

.if @MANPAGE_BOOTTIME@ \{
boottime - Retrieves the system boottime.
\}

.if @MANPAGE_LOADAVG@ \{
loadavg1 - Retrieves the system load average over the last minute.

loadavg5 - Retrieves the system load average over the last five minutes.

loadavg15 - Retrieves the system load average over the last fifteen minutes.
\}

.if @MANPAGE_MEMORY@ \{
memtotal - Retrieves total system memory.

memused - Retrieves used system memory.

memfree - Retrieves free system memory.

swaptotal - Retrieves total swap space.

swapused - Retrieves used swap space.

swapfree - Retrieves free swap space.
\}

.if @MANPAGE_NETWORK@ \{
bytesin - Retrieves total bytes received on the network.

bytesout - Retrieves total bytes sent on the network.

packetsin - Retrieves total packets received on the network.

packetsout - Retrieves total packets sent on the network.

rxerrs - Retrieves total receive errors.

txerrs - Retrieves total transmission errors.
\}

.if @MANPAGE_SHUTDOWN@ \{
shutdown - Metric that is sent if the machine was recently shutdown gracefully.
\}

Metric modules are searched for in the
.B Cerebro
package library directory, @CEREBRO_MODULE_DIR@.

.SH "MONITOR MODULES"

Monitor modules provide a way for additional tasks to be executed done
while monitoring some metric.  For example, if logging to a database
is required for some unique metric handled by a metric module, a
monitoring module could be written to log that data to database
whenever a packet with that metric is read.

The following monitoring modules are distributed:

No monitoring modules are built.

Monitor modules are searched for in the
.B Cerebro
package library directory, @CEREBRO_MODULE_DIR@.

.SH "EVENT MODULES"

Event modules provide a way for events to be generated when certain
monitored events occur.  This allows the user to program tools to
only react when a monitored event occurs.  For example, a tool
may wish to perform an action only after a node has been confirmed
to be down.

The following event modules are distributed:

updown - Sends event notifications when cluster nodes go up or down

Event modules are searched for in the
.B Cerebro
package library directory, @CEREBRO_MODULE_DIR@.
